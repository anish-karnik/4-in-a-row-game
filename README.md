## 4-in-a-row Game

### about game
4-in-a-Row, also known as Connect Four, is a classic two-player strategy game where players compete to align four of their pieces in a row on a vertical grid. The grid typically consists of 6 rows and 7 columns, and players take turns dropping colored discs into the columns. The goal is to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four consecutive discs while preventing the opponent from doing the same.
